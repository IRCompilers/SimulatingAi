For example:\n> \n> * **Individualism:** The emphasis is on personal achievement and self-reliance.\n> * **Collectivism:** Meaning is found in relationships and contributing to the group.\n> * **Traditional societies:** Meaning is often rooted in religious or mythological beliefs.\n> \n> Ultimately, the meaning of life is a personal and subjective experience. There is no single, objective answer that applies to everyone. It is a question that individuals can explore throughout their lives, as they seek purpose, fulfillment, and connection."
